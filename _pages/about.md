About me
I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology, advised by Prof. Mingkui Tan. I engage in achieving 3D Reconstruction with limited sources. Toward this goal, my research mainly focus on:

* `<b>3D Digital Human Recostruction</b>`: Single-view-based 3D Reconstruction; Text-driven 3D Reconstruction
* `<b>`3D Scene Reconstruction `</b>`: 3D Reconstruction from In-the-wild images. SIngle-view-based Light Field Reconstruction

<!-- * My primary research interests are in <b>Visual Understanding</b> and mainly focus on:
  * <b>Video Understanding</b>: self-supervised video representation learning, temporal action localization;
  * <b>Embodied AI</b>: vision-and-language navigation; -->

I am currently seeking jobs specializing in Digital Human, 3D Reconstruction. If you have a suitable position available, please feel free to contact me.
